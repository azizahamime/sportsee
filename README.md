## Scripts

☑️ `npm start` :command will allow you to run the application on http://localhost:8081

The Web App calls the api on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000). Ensure the api is running by following this link: [run backend api](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard#22-launching-the-project).

☑️`npm run mirage` : command will allow you to run the application on: http://localhost:8082/ 

The web app calls the mocked api, we can change datas on "src/Data.js" to see the difference. 

## Test
Once app is launched go to "profile" to see dashboards.
you can change the userId (change number 12 by 20 (if you run the mocked api) else change the number 12 by 18 into the URL) to display other profiles saved in data base.
